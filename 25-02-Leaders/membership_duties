The Membership Committee shall be responsible for:

1. Maintaining a reasonably up to date roster of PCREC members and contact info where known
   (see Mike Surette).
1. Maintaining a roster of Pinellas Watchdogs members, showing precinct, contact info, assigned
   committee and active/inactive status.  This is used to determine the quorum needed for meetings.
1. Providing different name tags for members vs guests at Pinellas Watchdogs meetings.
1. Placing the member's committee on their name tag.
1. Providing Pinellas Watchdogs members with a voting card.  Each card will have a unique number
   printed on both sides using letters at least 1.5" tall.  The Chair will identify people by number.
   The cards for Active and inactive members will be distinguishable from each other (perhaps
   active with numbers below 100 and inactive above 100).
1. Maintaining a quorum count of the number of active members attending the meeting.
   The numbers on the voter cards may be used to count how many active members showed up for
   the quorum, as well as how many members have left the meeting when they turn their card in
   as they leave.
